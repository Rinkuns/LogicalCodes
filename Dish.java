/*Reducing Dishes: Monica has cooked N dishes and collected the data on the level of satisfaction for all the dishes from a guest. 
  The guest returns an array, where the i th element of the array is the liking level of the i th dish, also the time taken to cook 
  the i th dish is i.
Like-to-time coefficient of a dish is calculated by multiplying the time taken to cook food with itâ€™s liking level. i.e i*input2[i]. 
Total like-to-time coefficient is calculated by summing up all individual coefficients of dishes.
You want the total like-to-time coefficient to be maximum, you can also remove some dishes, in which a new coefficient is calculated 
using the left dishes.
Find the maximum sum of all possible like-to-time coefficients.

Input Specification:
input1: N, number of dishes
input2: Array representing the liking value of each dish.

Output Specification:
Return maximum like-to-time coefficient possible

Example1:

input1: 3
input2: {-1,3,4}
Output: 17

Explanation:

She should not cancel cooking the first dish, since total coefficient without canceling equals 1(-1) + 2(3) + 3(4) = 17
If she would have cancelled cooking for the first dish, the like-to-time coefficient would be 1(3) + 2(4) = 11
Hence, she should cook all 3 dishes from maximum like-to-time coefficient possible.*/
